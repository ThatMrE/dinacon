Projects done during Dinacon 2019

Dinacon was a fantastic unparalleled experience that pushed me beyond my limits. It was less than a week of living and working in the jungle on projects that related to conservation, human connection with nature and repurposing trash into beauty.

While at Dinacon, I ended up completing 4 projects, 1 of which was a collaboration:

..*Firefly Fornication Foyer
..*Morpho Mixtape
..*Trash Cake
..*Biocyborg (collaboration)

## Firefly Fornication Foyer
The Firefly Fornication Foyer for fabulous philandering fiends physically fucking freely in a funky frenzy; fundamentally unfazed and unfrazzeled not frowning, fawning forcefully for fuzzbox and phallic fetishes. F^22  

Fireflies are gradually going extinct due to global warming, an increase in light pollution and encroachment on natural habitats. It's incredibly important to create a safe consensual space for them to light up their sex life and find their spark. At Dinacon 2019, I created a Bug Brothel to draw in and give shelter to fireflies looking to get it on.

Fireflies are drawn in by the mating flashes of both male and female Photinus pyralis. They come in the bottom and get stuck inside; mixing and mingling making mistakes. And I was always told mistakes in the dark cause children ;) The morning after, we make them breakfast and set them free - no more walk of shame, they proudly reignited the spark in their love lives. 

It is my hope that this kind of device can help repopulate firefly species and build back some of the joy and wonder I experienced as a kid watching the woods light up with love.
